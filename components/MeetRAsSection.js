          During the 2021-2022 Fiscal Year, SPEC / CAREP research associates, 
          project staff and collaborators worked together throughout the 
          project-building process. All are excited to continue to share knowledge, 
          and resources, and collaboratively innovate to create systemic change in 
          their communities. Funding for this research was provided by unrestricted 
          gifts from RAND supporters and income from operations, with which RAND 
          established the Center to Advance Racial Equity Policy in 2020.
