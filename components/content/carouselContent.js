        "The partnership between RAND and SPEC has allowed me to gain valuable software development experience in an enriching, collaborative, and inclusive space. Our projects involved building different applications and systems with popular tech stacks, providing me with a better tool set to enter the tech sector. I was encouraged to ask questions, try different solutions, and connect with people that delivered additional resources and ideas. What once made me feel like a solo climber facing a daunting mountain soon transformed into a fantastic and supportive core team ready to help everyone ascend to the top. I now feel confident stepping into a sector I previously had minimal experience in, with the ability to always make a conscious effort to provide a meaningful impact in all communities I am a part of.",

Meeting with Dr. Rhianna Rogers gave me invaluable insight into cultivating cultural competence and how to begin development with the end-user in mind, thereby focusing first and foremost on inclusiveness and accessibility. Having a personal understanding of these principles and how they serve as a foundation for promoting social justice and racial equity online helped guide my vision when I began contributing to RAND-SPEC software development projects. As an associate developer, the mentorship and support I've received from the SPEC and Of Ash and Fire teams have been instrumental to my growth and success.",

As a junior developer, I was eager to quickly start building systems with software and learn as much as possible. I was able to build out microcredential courses on an open-source learn management system and contribute to building the impact website with Of Ash and Fire. I quickly understood the importance of mindfulness of unconscious biases and how to build systems that are inclusive to multiple end-users. I also enjoyed having regular meetings with Dr. Rhianna Rogers and other Research Associates to have an open conversation about our perspectives.",

Improving asynchronous communication habits, motivating individual members, and working on projects that advance the greater good has been the best part of this position. There were differences in opinion at times, and working collaboratively to find common ground was especially rewarding. It is astounding to see how much our team and I have grown and accomplished during the past few months while helping create valuable educational resources to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion-centered training.",

I began helping with research and learned new methods and knowledge about RAND and each potential topic for the game idea. Once the game topic was chosen, it was great to be able to dive deeper into the research articles on that topic to gain more insight into the game direction. I was also offered the opportunity to participate in and complete the CITI Program training. During this course, I learned about the history and principles of research on human subjects. Not only did this help me on the RAND gaming project but also in future opportunities. I am so grateful for this experience. The leaders and mentors have guided me through the process, and I have gained new knowledge. I know I am now a better researcher, designer, and team member.",

Together, we aimed to empower artists to raise awareness and build community and for our viewers to recognize and let go of the stereotypes we have about those who live outside our common communities and who are different from ourselves. Our gallery offers an opportunity to better explore the landscape of cultural diversities and value each other's unique backgrounds and experiences. Recently, letters from the inmates thanking us for sharing their work demonstrate the impact of our efforts. I'm inspired to continue to look to discover ways to employ the arts to connect with each other when we live in such separate and divided communities.",

I was independent with a team-structured safety net that allowed me to take risks, fail, learn, and grow as a teammate as well as a Software Developer. Three months after joining SPEC, I was hired for my first full-time Software Engineering role. My team celebrated my accomplishment and helped me prepare for my new role.",

The life of the project created unique opportunities to upskill in project management, especially with tech-centered projects where roles and processes remain fairly fluid. Coming from a background of working with museums, governments, and private sector firms, this partnership presented unique challenges around project management that have helped me become a better-rounded project manager. I cannot say enough about the SPEC RAs we have had work on this project. More than anything, I am grateful for the opportunity to mentor, manage, and work alongside each of the RAs, as they also met the challenges of this project head-on and grew both personally and professionally. It has been wonderful to see some reach their ultimate goal of landing full-time tech jobs and to see othersâ€™ goals change and become permanent fixtures at SPEC.",

Over the past 13 years, I've worked with many individuals and several institutions to develop and teach online college courses at undergrad and grad levels. The development process at SPEC is an exceptional pleasure because of its egalitarian intern program. Hearing the voices and sharing content development with people who have diverse approaches, diverse knowledge sources, and stakes in varying outcomes is illuminating. It helped us build inclusive, welcoming courses that have demonstrated strong learning outcomes. Adapting the product of this egalitarian process for an institution such as RAND has also been educational. I appreciate the opportunity.",

Previously, I worked as a contributing professional in traditional corporate and government hierarchical structures interacting with line managers or department heads. However, this project involved deep collaboration as a team of content developers and one Project Manager. Our team works 100% remotely, but we weren't siloed; many meetings were in-depth strategy sessions discussing the best way to approach the next phase of the project. Our team hails from various academic disciplines across the humanities, social sciences, and different work backgrounds; each brought their content expertise and perspective to the table. Because we operated on a flat structure, we could connect ideas in a way that we would not have if each of us were working alone. It was interesting (and challenging!) to collaborate in this way.",
