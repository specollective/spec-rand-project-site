        "The partnership between RAND and SPEC has allowed me to gain valuable software development experience in an enriching, collaborative, and inclusive space. Our projects involved building different applications and systems with popular tech stacks, providing me with a better tool set to enter the tech sector. I was encouraged to ask questions, try different solutions, and connect with people that delivered additional resources and ideas. What once made me feel like a solo climber facing a daunting mountain soon transformed into a fantastic and supportive core team ready to help everyone ascend to the top. I now feel confident stepping into a sector I previously had minimal experience in, with the ability to always make a conscious effort to provide a meaningful impact in all communities I am a part of.",

        "I'm so grateful to be a part of the SPEC team and to have had the opportunity to work on several projects for the RAND corporation. Meeting with Dr. Rhianna Rogers gave me invaluable insight into cultivating cultural competence and how to begin development with the end-user in mind, thereby focusing first and foremost on inclusiveness and accessibility. Having a personal understanding of these principles and how they serve as a foundation for promoting social justice and racial equity online helped guide my vision when I began contributing to RAND-SPEC software development projects. As an associate developer, the mentorship and support I've received from the SPEC and Of Ash and Fire teams have been instrumental to my growth and success.",

        "Working on the SPEC team on multiple RAND projects has given me so much insight into being a better developer and advocate for social and racial equity. As a junior developer, I was eager to quickly start building systems with software and learn as much as possible. I was able to build out microcredential courses on an open-source learn management system and contribute to building the impact website with Of Ash and Fire. I quickly understood the importance of mindfulness of unconscious biases and how to build systems that are inclusive to multiple end-users. I also enjoyed having regular meetings with Dr. Rhianna Rogers and other Research Associates to have an open conversation about our perspectives.",

        "I came to SPEC interested in growing my project management skills and was happy to join the RA cohort working with RAND on building microcredentials and developing educational games. I've received mentorship through this collaboration, helping me become a better leader for the SPEC team. Improving asynchronous communication habits, motivating individual members, and working on projects that advance the greater good has been the best part of this position. There were differences in opinion at times, and working collaboratively to find common ground was especially rewarding. It is astounding to see how much our team and I have grown and accomplished during the past few months while helping create valuable educational resources to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion-centered training.",

        "Working on the RAND gaming project has been such an informative experience for me. I began helping with research and learned new methods and knowledge about RAND and each potential topic for the game idea. Once the game topic was chosen, it was great to be able to dive deeper into the research articles on that topic to gain more insight into the game direction. I was also offered the opportunity to participate in and complete the CITI Program training. During this course, I learned about the history and principles of research on human subjects. Not only did this help me on the RAND gaming project but also in future opportunities. I am so grateful for this experience. The leaders and mentors have guided me through the process, and I have gained new knowledge. I know I am now a better researcher, designer, and team member.",
